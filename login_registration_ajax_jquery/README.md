In this task I firstly created a login and registration page through html. 

Login page:
![login_page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99468260/169962444-1a258a23-fe9f-426c-b280-c7052e33f9b4.png)

Registration page:
![registration_form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99468260/169962568-db5049b5-e2ef-4d1f-8269-762e609d36f1.png)

Firstly it will display the login page. If you already created an account with the dtails you have to login. After login it will show a table of who 
are the members registered already. If you are not a member it will displays the registration page and you have to register.

Add User:  In that table if you want to add a new user you can add a new user by clicking on new user button and by adding all the details of new user.

Edit:  If you want to edit any details you can simply click on edit button and can change your details and save it.

Delete:  You can delete any person click on delete button the person details will get deleted.

Details page:

If you want to sign out from the page you can click on sign out button and you will get signed out.

All this code is done by using AJAX.
