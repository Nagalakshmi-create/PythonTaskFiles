                Tendulkar scored his much awaited 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012 against 
                Bangladesh in the Asia Cup. He became the first person in history to achieve this feat. 
                Incidentally, it was Tendulkar's first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said "It's been 
                a tough phase for me ... I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all 
                this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th 
                hundred. Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody 
                talked about my 99 hundreds."
