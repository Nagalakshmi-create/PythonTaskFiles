            According to the social historian Derek Birley, there was a "great upsurge of 
            sport after the Restoration" in 1660.[25] Several members of the court of King Charles II 
            took a strong interest in cricket during that era.[26] Gambling on sport became a problem 
            significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to £100
             which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population.
             [25] Along with prizefighting, horse racing and blood sports, cricket was perceived to be 
             a gambling sport.[27] Rich patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which 
             they engaged the first professional players.[28] By the end of the century, cricket had 
             developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being 
             taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers – the earliest reference to cricket overseas i
             s dated 1676.[29] A 1697 newspaper report survives of "a great cricket match" played in 
             Sussex "for fifty guineas apiece" – this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a First Class match.
