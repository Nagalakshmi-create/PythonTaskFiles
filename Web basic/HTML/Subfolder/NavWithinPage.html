            <h2>About Sachin</h2>
            <p>
                In the Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory. However, he was out when India needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12 runs.[102] The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.[103] However, he returned to the World Cup scoring a century (140 not out of 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.[104]

            <p>
                Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests.[138] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise.[139] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.[140][141] After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.[142]

            <p>
                On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest[needs update] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.[146] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.[147] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[148] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory.[149] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd,[150] the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.
